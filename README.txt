# AI Food Coach — Static Website

A clean, responsive single-page site (HTML/CSS/JS) with a basic rule-based coach demo.
No frameworks. Ready for GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.

## Files
- `index.html` — full webpage with sections (Hero, How, Features, Demo, FAQ, Contact)
- `styles.css` — responsive styles
- `script.js` — nav toggle, smooth scroll, demo logic, and a simple contact placeholder
- `assets/` — favicon and logo

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. (Or serve with any static server.)

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo and push these files.
2. In repo settings → Pages → Source: `main` / root.
3. Wait a minute; your site goes live.

## Next steps
- Replace the contact placeholder with a real backend or form service.
- Add AI `/api/coach` endpoint + switch to fetch if desired.
- Add photo logging and user auth when ready.
